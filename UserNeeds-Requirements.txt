This application is designed for visual knowledge management. Based on the provided requirements, here is a set of high-level user needs and corresponding user requirements, expressed without specific solution details like "SVG," "fly-in panel," or "28px diameter."

## 🚀 High-Level User Needs

The primary user needs revolve around the efficient and intuitive creation, organization, and connection of visual information.

* **Need for Visual Organization:** Users need a way to organize and view interconnected pieces of information in a non-linear, spatial format.
* **Need for Information Capture:** Users need to capture different types of information—text, tasks, and media—within a single structure.
* **Need for Relationship Mapping:** Users need to easily define and understand the relationships between different pieces of information.
* **Need for Efficient Workflow:** Users need to manage their information and tasks quickly and efficiently using various interaction methods (mouse and keyboard).
* **Need for Data Persistence and Retrieval:** Users need their work to be automatically saved and easily accessible.

## ✨ User Requirements (Solution-Free)

### 1. Information Structuring & Representation
* [cite_start]The system must allow the creation of distinct, fundamental units of information (nodes)[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]The system must arrange these units in a circular, visual layout by default[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]Users must be able to visually customize each unit (e.g., color, background image) for categorization and identity[cite: 4, 1].
* [cite_start]Each unit must support a title, a detailed description, and attachment of multiple images/media[cite: 3, 4].

### 2. Connection Management
* [cite_start]The system must provide a clear mechanism to create and display bidirectional relationships (links) between any two information units[cite: 3, 4].
* [cite_start]Relationships must remain stable and visually represented when units are repositioned[cite: 3].

### 3. Content and Task Management
* [cite_start]Each information unit must support a checklist/to-do list feature with completion tracking[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]The system must visually alert the user to incomplete tasks within an information unit[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]Text descriptions must automatically recognize and link URLs for external access[cite: 3, 11].

### 4. Interaction and Manipulation
* [cite_start]Users must be able to reposition individual and multiple selected information units[cite: 1, 5].
* [cite_start]The system must support methods for selecting multiple units, including toggling selection and area-based selection[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]Users must have the ability to quickly duplicate an information unit[cite: 3, 9].
* [cite_start]The application must support smooth navigation of the visual canvas, including zooming and panning[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]Key operations must have intuitive keyboard shortcuts (e.g., for navigation, editing, and closing views)[cite: 8].

### 5. Search and Retrieval
* [cite_start]The system must support real-time searching and filtering of information units based on their title[cite: 8, 15].
* [cite_start]Search results must visually highlight matching units and diminish the visibility of non-matching units[cite: 6, 15].
* [cite_start]The system must provide a chronological view of all created information units for historical access[cite: 10, 16].

### 6. Data Integrity and Persistence
* [cite_start]All user work must be automatically and continuously saved without requiring a manual save action[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]The system must ensure that all information units have a unique identifier[cite: 3, 20].
* [cite_start]The system must alert the user if they attempt to create a duplicate title for an information unit[cite: 3, 11, 20].
* [cite_start]The system must maintain data consistency, such as ensuring relationship links are removed when an information unit is deleted[cite: 20].
