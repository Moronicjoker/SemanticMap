1. INTRODUCTION
========================================================================

1.1 What is Semantic Map?
--------------------------
Semantic Map is a visual knowledge mapping tool that helps you organize
your thoughts, ideas, and information in a spatial, interconnected way.
Unlike traditional note-taking apps, Semantic Map lets you:

• Create visual nodes representing concepts or ideas
• Connect related nodes to show relationships
• Navigate through your knowledge spatially
• Add rich content including text, images, and to-do lists
• See your thinking evolve over time with the timeline feature

Think of it as a digital whiteboard that remembers everything and helps
you see the connections between your ideas.


1.2 Who Should Use It?
-----------------------
Semantic Map is perfect for:

✓ Researchers organizing literature and findings
✓ Students mapping course concepts and study materials
✓ Project managers tracking tasks and dependencies
✓ Writers planning stories and character relationships
✓ Developers documenting system architectures
✓ Anyone who thinks visually and wants to connect ideas


1.3 Getting Started
-------------------
To start using Semantic Map:

1. Open the SemanticMap.html file in your web browser
2. You'll see a dark canvas - this is your workspace
3. Click anywhere on the canvas to create your first node
4. Type a title for your node
5. You're ready to start mapping!

NOTE: Semantic Map runs entirely in your browser. To save your work,
use your browser's save function (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S) to save the HTML
file. Your data is embedded in the file.

========================================================================
2. BASIC CONCEPTS
========================================================================

2.1 Understanding Nodes
------------------------
Nodes are the building blocks of your semantic map. Each node represents
a single concept, idea, task, or piece of information.

VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS:
• Nodes appear as colored circles on the canvas
• Each node has a text label below it
• Node size changes based on how many connections it has:
  - Small circles (18px): 0-2 connections
  - Medium circles (28px): 3-5 connections
  - Large circles (38px): 6+ connections

WHAT A NODE CAN CONTAIN:
• A title (required)
• A detailed description with markdown formatting
• Multiple images
• To-do lists with checkboxes
• Links to other nodes
• Web links
• A background image


2.2 Understanding Connections
------------------------------
Connections are lines that link related nodes together. They represent
relationships, dependencies, or associations between ideas.

CONNECTION FEATURES:
• Visual lines between nodes
• Can be straight or curved (bendable)
• Color matches the source node
• Thickness indicates selection state
• Can be deleted by double-clicking


2.3 The Canvas
--------------
The canvas is your infinite workspace where nodes and connections live.

CANVAS FEATURES:
• Dark background for better focus
• Infinite scrolling in all directions
• Zoom from 0.1x to 10x magnification
• Click empty space to create new nodes
• Select multiple nodes with box selection


2.4 The Timeline
----------------
The timeline shows your nodes in chronological order, allowing you to
see how your map evolved over time.

TIMELINE FEATURES:
• Shows all nodes from oldest to newest
• Displays creation date and time
• Click any entry to jump to that node
• Can be hidden/shown with toggle button

========================================================================

========================================================================
6. WORKING WITH CONNECTIONS
========================================================================

6.1 Creating Connections
-------------------------
See Section 3.4 for basic connection creation.

ADDITIONAL TIPS:
• Connections are bidirectional (no arrows)
• The line color matches the source node
• You can create connections while editing a node
• Connections appear in the "Connected Nodes" section


6.2 Bending Connections
-----------------------
Sometimes you want a curved connection instead of a straight line.

TO ADD A CURVE:
1. Select one of the connected nodes
2. Click on the connection line
3. A control point appears where you clicked
4. Drag the control point to bend the line
5. The line curves smoothly through the point

CONTROL POINT FEATURES:
• Maximum 2 control points per connection
• Visible as small circles on the line
• Drag to reposition
• Double-click to remove
• Move with nodes when both nodes are selected

TIP: Use curved connections to avoid overlapping lines and improve
visual clarity in complex maps.


6.3 Deleting Connections
-------------------------
METHOD 1: Double-Click the Line
1. Double-click any connection line
2. The connection is immediately removed
3. No confirmation needed

METHOD 2: From Connected Nodes List
1. Open the edit panel for either connected node
2. Find the "Connected Nodes" section
3. Click the × button next to the node name
4. The connection is removed

METHOD 3: Delete from Description
1. If you linked nodes using [[syntax]] in description
2. Delete the [[NodeName|id]] link from the text
3. The visual connection is removed automatically


6.4 Understanding Connection Thickness
---------------------------------------
Connection lines change thickness to show context:

THIN (1px): Default state, neither node selected
MEDIUM (2px): One connected node is selected
THICK (3px): Hovering over the connection (when selectable)

This helps you see which connections belong to your selected nodes.

========================================================================
7. ORGANIZING YOUR THOUGHTS
========================================================================

7.1 Using Markdown Formatting
------------------------------
Node descriptions support markdown formatting:

BOLD TEXT:
Type: **important text**
Shows: important text (in bold)

ITALIC TEXT:
Type: *emphasized text*
Shows: emphasized text (in italics)

CODE/MONOSPACE:
Type: `code snippet`
Shows: code snippet (in monospace font)

LINKS:
Type: [Visit Website](https://example.com)
Shows: Clickable link that opens in new tab

PLAIN URLS:
Type: https://example.com
Shows: Automatically becomes clickable link

TIP: Click outside the text area to see the formatted preview.
Click the preview to edit again.


7.2 Creating To-Do Lists
-------------------------
You can add interactive checkboxes to any node:

UNCHECKED TODO:
Type: - [ ] Task to complete
Shows: ☐ Task to complete (clickable checkbox)

CHECKED TODO:
Type: - [x] Completed task
Shows: ☑ Completed task (with strikethrough)

WORKING WITH CHECKBOXES:
• Click checkboxes in the preview to toggle state
• Checked items show strikethrough and fade
• Timestamps are added automatically (see next section)
• Works with indentation: add spaces before the hyphen


7.3 Adding Timestamps
---------------------
Semantic Map automatically adds timestamps to your to-do items:

AUTOMATIC TIMESTAMPS:
• Added when you check/uncheck a todo
• Added when you stop editing (textarea loses focus)
• Format: "MMM D, YYYY HH:MM" (e.g., "Nov 13, 2025 14:30")
• Appears in small gray text below the todo

WHAT IT TRACKS:
• When a todo was created
• When it was checked off
• When it was unchecked

This helps you track your progress and when tasks were completed.


7.4 Linking to Other Nodes
---------------------------
You can create clickable links to other nodes in your map:

TO CREATE A NODE LINK:
1. Type [[ in the description
2. An autocomplete menu appears
3. Start typing a node name
4. Use arrow keys to select a node
5. Press Enter to insert the link

RESULT:
[[Node Title|12345]] becomes a clickable blue link

AUTOCOMPLETE FEATURES:
• Filters as you type
• Shows node titles and IDs
• Arrow Up/Down to navigate
• Enter to select
• Escape to cancel

CLICKING NODE LINKS:
• Click the link in preview mode
• View zooms to that node
• Edit panel opens for that node
• A visual connection appears automatically

TIP: This is the best way to link related concepts together!


7.5 Adding Web Links
---------------------
URLs in your descriptions automatically become clickable:

AUTOMATIC LINK DETECTION:
• Type any URL: https://example.com
• Or: www.example.com
• Or: example.com
• They become clickable automatically

MARKDOWN LINKS:
• Type: [Click here](https://example.com)
• Shows: "Click here" as clickable text

All links open in a new browser tab for safety.

========================================================================

14.1 Common Issues
------------------

ISSUE: "I can't find my nodes"
SOLUTION: Click "Show All" button at top-left

ISSUE: "Search isn't working"
SOLUTION: 
• Make sure you're clicking in the search box
• Text must be in title or description
• Try different keywords

ISSUE: "Connection won't create"
SOLUTION:
• Make sure you're holding Shift when clicking first node
• Connection might already exist (duplicates not allowed)
• Try clicking closer to the center of the target node

ISSUE: "Node won't move"
SOLUTION:
• You might be clicking too lightly (drag it more than 5 pixels)
• If it opens the panel, try clicking and dragging in one motion

ISSUE: "Panel won't close"
SOLUTION:
• Click the × button in panel header
• Or press Escape key
• Check if you're in a text field (click outside first)

ISSUE: "My changes aren't saving"
SOLUTION:
• Semantic Map auto-saves to its internal data
• You must save the HTML file (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S) to persist
• Without saving the file, data is lost when page closes

ISSUE: "Timeline is missing"
SOLUTION:
• Look for button at bottom-left corner
• Click it to show timeline
• Timeline might be collapsed

ISSUE: "Images won't upload"
SOLUTION:
• Make sure you have a node's edit panel open
• Try smaller images (very large images may be slow)
• Check browser console for errors
• Try a different image format


14.2 Data Recovery
------------------

IF YOU CLOSED WITHOUT SAVING:
• Data is lost if page was closed
• Browser might have page in history (Back button)
• Check browser's "Recently Closed" feature
• Prevention: Save frequently!

IF FILE WON'T OPEN:
• Make sure you're opening the .html file
• Try different browser
• Check file isn't corrupted (file size should be > 100KB if it has data)

BACKUP STRATEGY:
• Save multiple versions with dates in filename
• Example: "MyMap_2025-11-13_morning.html"
• Keep backups in cloud storage
• Before major changes, save a copy first


14.3 Browser Compatibility
---------------------------

RECOMMENDED BROWSERS:
✓ Google Chrome (latest version)
✓ Microsoft Edge (latest version)
✓ Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
✓ Safari (latest version)

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:
• Modern browser (2020 or newer)
• JavaScript enabled
• Cookies enabled
• Minimum 1280×720 screen resolution
• 4GB RAM (for large maps with images)

PERFORMANCE TIPS:
• Limit images to reasonable sizes (< 2MB each)
• Very large maps (500+ nodes) may be slow
• Close other browser tabs for better performance
• Zoom out less frequently on older computers

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
• Does not work in Internet Explorer
• Mobile browsers not optimized (desktop only)
• Some keyboard shortcuts may vary by OS

========================================================================

NEED MORE HELP?
---------------
• Review the UI Requirements document for technical details
• Experiment! You can't break anything permanently
• Save a backup before trying advanced features
• Start simple and add complexity gradually

========================================================================

ENJOY MAPPING YOUR KNOWLEDGE!
